#What is this Project About??
This project is written in python3 builds upon selenium, geckodriver etc.
With this project we exploit a very fundamental instint of a user using 
Instagram. 

I too did this :
Whenever a person likes my photo and also comments on it, I mostly follow him 
back.Thus this increases the followers of that user.

#What are we going to do?
We will have a comma separated value file in which you can save all the hashtags 
that you find has the same content that your instagram account has and we will
like all the photos regarding that particular hashtag and wait for people to follow you back.
